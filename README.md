ButtBot (A Discord ButtBot)
==========================
This ButtBot was insipred by the old IRC buttbot, but uses modern natural language processing to ascend to greatness
instead of a silly word list.

What the hell does this look like?
----------------------------
Well, it says butt, sometimes.


I want ButtBot on my server!

Configuration
----------------------------
By default, buttbot will not talk in channels.

You can give him permission to talk in a channel by typing ```&config allow``` in the channel.

You can remove this by typing: ```&config remove```

By default, buttbot also will not butt anything coming from other bots. You can enable this by
typing ```&config botallow <bot guid>``` in any channel in your guild. Note that he may mangle game chat relay systems (
for example, a mod that puts your minecraft chat in your discord server).

Contribution
------------
Look I mean this is just a side project with no real direction or effort so if you want to PR something that will make
this better please reach out.
